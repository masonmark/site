Hey this is super cool. Netlify has a React-based (open-source 👍🏻) CMS built right into their shit and they provide integration with Hugo (and like Jekyll and shit too).

So it means my Netlify-hosted website — which is **MAINLY** a blog but not exclusively so (it also has any other shit that I want on my personal HTTPS website, such as fart jokes, dick pics, etc.) — can be easily edited quickly using this widget that is built right into it — **OR** I can edit the site meticulously in VS Code locally on my Mac and push it when I want to deploy it. Fucken **RAD** breaux...
